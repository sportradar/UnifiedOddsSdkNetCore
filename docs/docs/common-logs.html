<p>The following are the examples of sdk logs you'll find for some common scenarios</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the validation problems are because of the mismatch between market-associated specifiers and which specifiers are expected based on the market description. This is just a log entry; the
message is processed and dispatched to the user code normally.</li>

</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>When subscribing to raw data (feed and API) utilizing FeedExt instead of a normal Feed instance, SDK logs how long it took in user code to process the raw message. Long times could indicate
problems in user code and will slow down message processing in the SDK pipeline.</li>

done on every message, and some on timer (in case no message arrive). <br>On timer (every 10s) it also checks the state of the producer. That is the state as sdk sees it, and does not reflect
the state of the server producer.</li>

<li>On timer the state of each available producer is checked. Tracking is also done for each configured session.
<ul>
<li>The &quot;age&quot; specifies the time elapsed from message generation (by the feed) and the current time (i.e. current_time - message_generation_time).</li>
<li>The &quot;latency&quot; specifies the time elapsed message generation (by the feed) and when it was received by the SDK(i.e. message_receival_time - message_generation_time).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Log entry explanation: The entry can be break-down into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Producer info: <strong>1(LO):[IsUp=False,Timestamp=01.01.0001-00:00:00.000(Started)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>1(LO)</strong> - the id and name of the producer</li>
<li><strong>IsUp=False</strong> - whether the producer is marked as &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; at a moment the entry was written</li>
<li><strong>Timestamp=01.01.0001-00:00:00.000</strong> - The &quot;Timestamp before disconnect&quot; - indicating the time from which the recovery has to be made if the SDK is restarted. Value 01.01.0001-00:00:00.000 is a
min date/time that can be represented in .net framework and indicates that a full recovery needs to be done.</li>
<li><strong>(Started)</strong> - internal state of the producer. The following values are defined:
<ul>
<li><strong>NotStarted</strong> - the recovery has not been started yet</li>
<li><strong>Started</strong> - the recovery has been started and is still in progress</li>
<li><strong>Completed</strong> - the recovery has been completed and the status of the producer is up-to-date</li>
<li><strong>Error</strong> - the recovery has failed and will be re-started when the next alive is received from the feed</li>
<li><strong>FatalError</strong> - the recovery has failed with un-recoverable error and will not be attempted again. This only happens when the recovery timestamp is set to much in the past and therefore
cannot be initiated.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed</strong> - the recovery has been completed and the status of the producer is up-to-date, but the user is falling behind with message processing (processing is to slow).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>timing info: <strong>[[Ping(Ok):age=00:00:01,918],[IsBehind(True):Alive(s)[all:age=00:08:17,088],NonAlives[all:latency=00:05:20,859]]]</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ping(Ok)</strong> - whether the producer is behaving as expected (based on the age of the last alive message being smaller than maxInactivitySeconds config property</li>
<li><strong>age=00:00:01,918</strong> - the age of the last alive message received on a session which is not affected by other messages</li>
<li><strong>IsBehind(True)</strong> - specifies whether the user is falling behind on message processing. The producer is considered as &quot;behind&quot; when either latency or age of any message is larger than
maxInactivitySeconds</li>
<li><strong>Alive(s)[all:age=00:08:17,088]</strong> - the age of last alive message received on user created sessions. If the user created more than one session, the output will specify multiple ages</li>
<li><strong>NonAlives[all:latency=00:05:20,859]</strong> - the latency of last non-alive (bet_stop, odds_change) message received on user created sessions. If the user created more than one session, the output
will
specify multiple latencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
