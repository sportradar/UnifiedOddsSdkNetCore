    "keywords": "UnifiedOdds Feed SDK .NET library (.NET Standard 2.0) Notice: before starting DemoProject make sure to enter your bookmaker access token in app.config file and restore nuget packages by right-clicking the solution item and selecting \"Restore NuGet Packages\". Below are basic examples that can help you start using sdk. A basic way to use the UofSdk To receive sdk events/messages subscribe to all Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK.Api.IUofSdk and Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK.Api. IEntityDispatcher events. Note that there is one thread handling message reception and calling your event handler per session, so the processing within that method should be as quick as possible to not prevent following messages from being processed. It is recommended that all Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK.Entities.Rest.ISportEvent processing is done in separate thread. Below example is the minimum setup to start receiving messages. Note that you open only once, process messages for as long as you want, and then close the feed. var config = UofSdk.GetConfigurationBuilder().BuildFromConfigFile(); var uofSdk = new UofSdk(config); var session = uofSdk.GetSessionBuilder().SetMessageInterest(MessageInterest.AllMessages).Build(); uofSdk.ProducerUp += OnProducerUp; uofSdk.ProducerDown += OnProducerDown; uofSdk.Disconnected += OnDisconnected; uofSdk.Closed += OnClosed; session.OnUnparsableMessageReceived += SessionOnUnparsableMessageReceived; session.OnBetCancel += SessionOnBetCancel; session.OnBetSettlement += SessionOnBetSettlement; session.OnBetStop += SessionOnBetStop; session.OnFixtureChange += SessionOnFixtureChange; session.OnOddsChange += SessionOnOddsChange; session.OnRollbackBetCancel += SessionOnRollbackBetCancel; session.OnRollbackBetSettlement += SessionOnRollbackBetSettlement; uofSdk.Open();"

    "title": "UOF .NET SDK - Migration Guide | Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK",
    "keywords": "UOF .NET SDK - Migration Guide The Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDKCore library target framework was downgraded from .NET Standard 2.1 to .NET Standard 2.0, so this package can be used in any .NET Core and .NET project and also in old .NET Framework 4.6.2 or newer. No upgrades are planned for the nuget package Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK in the future and customer solutions should be upgraded to use Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDKCore. This is your roadmap to a smooth transition from your current SDK version to the latest version. The upgrade is designed to elevate your experience and align the SDK more closely with your business needs. Page Contents Upgrade Dependencies Build new UofSdk instance Update the methods and classes in your code Root Classes Renamed Removed methods and classes Added or changed methods Enum values renamed to CamelCase Changes and/or new features Name changes Changed namespaces Update the Configuration Upgrade configuration in App.config Other changes Through ConfigurationBuilder Test your project Update the Documentation Deploy to production Monitoring and Maintenance Feedback and Reporting Here are the general steps you can follow to complete the transition: 1. Upgrade Dependencies Upgrade Sdk nuget package to Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDKCore 2.0.0 or newer. Before upgrading you might need to upgrade some of the dependent libraries, like libraries for logging or dependency injection. SDK dependent libraries were upgraded or replaced. Removed libraries Newtonsoft.Json Castle.Core Added libraries Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks 7.0.11 Microsoft.Extensions.Http 7.0.0 Upgraded libraries Humanizer 2.8.26 -> 2.14.1 RabbitMQ.Client 5.1.2 -> 6.5.0 Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions 3.1.0 -> 7.0.0 System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager 4.7.0 -> 7.0.0 Replaced libraries App.Metrics with OpenTelemetry 1.6.0 System.Runtime.Caching with Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory 7.0.0 Unity with Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection 7.0.0 2. Build new UofSdk instance The feed instance is now named UofSdk. Building new feed instance is changed. You need to build configuration and register all the sdk services before creating new UofSdk instance. var uofConfiguration = UofSdk.GetConfigurationBuilder().BuildFromConfigFile(); var services = new ServiceCollection(); services.AddUofSdk(uofConfiguration); var uofSdk = new UofSdk(services.BuildServiceProvider()); Note: When configuring WebHost services (as in ASP.NET Core apps) via WebApplicationBuilder you should create a scope before creating UofSdk. Registering services for logging, telemetry and user classes is omitted for simplicity (but don't forget to add them). var webAppBuilder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args).WebHost.ConfigureServices( (hostBuilderContext, serviceCollection) => { serviceCollection.AddUofSdk(configuration); }); var app = webAppBuilder.Build(); var uofSdk = new UofSdk(app.Services.CreateScope().ServiceProvider); 3. Update the methods and classes in your code Review your codebase to identify any parts that might be affected by the upgrade. Look for deprecated methods or classes that have been removed in the new version. Update your code to use the new APIs provided by the UOF SDK 2.0.0. This may involve making changes to method calls, imports, and class references. Handle any breaking changes or deprecations by updating your code accordingly. You can contact support if you encounter specific issues. The following classes and methods are changed. Hence, you will be needed to update your code to use new names. Root Classes Renamed IOddsFeed to IUofSdk IOddsFeedSession to IUofSession Feed to UofSdk ReplayFeed to UofSdkForReplay IOddsFeedExt to IUofSdkExtended FeedExt to UofSdkExtended IOddsFeedConfigurationSection to IUofConfigurationSection OddsFeedConfigurationSection to UofConfigurationSection IOddsFeedConfiguration to IUofConfiguration Removed OperationManager (properties moved to IUofConfiguration) IEnvironmentSelector - removed SelectIntegration() and SelectProduction() - use SelectEnvironment (SdkEnvironment ufEnvironment) Renamed Feed.CreateBuilder() to UofSdk.GetSessionBuilder() for creating new IUofSession config section moved to Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK.Api.Internal.Config.UofConfigurationSection Removed methods and classes IOutcomeSettlement.Result IOddsFeedConfigurationSection.UseIntegrationEnvironment IRound.GroupName IRound.GetGroupName() Added or changed methods Added support for IVenue.Courses (returns list of ICourse instead of list of IHole) Enum values renamed to CamelCase MessageType ExceptionHandlingStrategy CashoutStatus FixtureChangeType MarketStatus OddsChangeReason PropertyUsage ResourceTypeGroup Changes and/or new features Added support for IVenue.Courses (returns list of ICourse instead of list of IHole) Added support for ICompetitor.Division - now contains division id and name (moved and replaced from ITeamCompetitor) Extended IJersey with SquareColor and HorizontalStripesColor Name changes The following are changed to improve the consistency. Some classes were also moved to different namespace. URN -> Urn ReplayPlayerStatus.Setting_up -> SettingUp IFixture.StartTimeTBD -> StartTimeTbd EventStatus.Not_Started -> NotStarted FeedMessage.EventURN -> EventUrn IRound.Name -> Names IRound.PhaseOrGroupLongName -> PhaseOrGroupLongNames IProducerManager.Get() -> GetProducer() Changed namespaces API namespace renamed to Api REST namespace renamed to Rest replay interfaces moved to Api.Replay UofSdk managers moved to Api.Managers UofSdk providers moved to Api.Managers enum types moved to Common.Enums IUofConfigurationSection moved to Api.Internal.Config configuration interfaces moved to Api.Config MessageInterest class moved to Api.Config 4. Update the Configuration The configuration settings were split between configuration class and OperationManager. OperationManager is removed and all settings are consolidated within the IUofConfiguration interface. You have two ways for constructing final configuration combining App.config and IConfigurationBuilder or just programmatically via IConfigurationBuilder Some of the options were removed from App.config section options and can only be configured via configuration builder. Upgrade configuration in App.config Replace <configSections> <section name=\"oddsFeedSection\" type=\"Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK.API.Internal.OddsFeedConfigurationSection,Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK\" /> </configSections> with <configSections> <section name=\"uofSdkSection\" type=\"Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK.Api.Internal.Config.UofConfigurationSection,Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK\" /> </configSections> Other changes You'll need to re-configure the following App.config configuration attributes. Key IsRequired Description accessToken yes The token you are currently using can also be used with our new version defaultLanguage or desiredLanguages yes desiredLanguages is renamed from supportedLanguages nodeId no Recommended to be set – must be unique per UofSdk instance environment no If not set, 'Integration' will be used. Note: renamed from ufEnvironment supportedLanguages no This is removed. Use desiredLanguages inactivitySeconds no This is removed from App.config. Can be set through configuration builder host no This setting is used only when using Custom environment useSsl no This setting is used only when using Custom environment virtualHost no This setting is used only when using Custom environment apiHost no This setting is used only when using custom environment apiUseSsl no This setting is used only when using Custom environment exceptionHandlingStrategy no Sets a ExceptionHandlingStrategy enum member specifying how to handle exceptions thrown to outside callers ('Catch' or 'Throw') disabledProducers no Sets the comma delimited list of ids of disabled producers (e.g. '1,2,7,9') maxRecoveryTime no This is removed from App.config. Can be set through configuration builder adjustAfterAge no This is removed from App.config. Can be set through configuration builder httpClientTimeout no This is removed from App.config. Can be set through configuration builder recoveryHttpClientTimeout no This is removed from App.config. Can be set through configuration builder Through ConfigurationBuilder The full configuration can be also setup via ConfigurationBuilder obtained via UofSdk.GetUofConfigurationBuilder(). The resulting IUofConfiguration contains all the previously set configurations for the SDK. 5. Test your project Thoroughly test your project after making the changes. Test all critical functionality to ensure that everything still works as expected. Pay special attention to any areas of your setup that interact with the sdk, as these are likely to be the most affected by the upgrade. 6. Update the Documentation Update your project's documentation and any training materials to reflect the changes introduced by the upgrade. This will help your team members understand and work with the new version. 7. Deploy to production Once you are confident that your project works correctly with the upgraded sdk, you can deploy the updated version to your production environment. 8. Monitoring and Maintenance After deployment, monitor your project closely for any unexpected issues or performance problems. Be prepared to address any post-upgrade issues promptly. 9. Feedback and Reporting If you encounter any bugs or issues in the Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDKCore v2.0.0 or newer, consider reporting them to support@sportradar.com. Providing feedback can help improve the SDK for future releases."

    "keywords": "UnifiedOdds Feed SDK .NET library (.NET Standard 2.0) UnifiedFeed SDK is a client library that enables easier integration with the Betradar XML feeds. SDK exposes XML feed service interface in a more user-friendly way and isolates the client from having to do XML feed parsing, proper connection handling, error recovery, event queuing, data caching and dispatching. It also makes a client solution more stable and robust when it comes to feed handling, especially with the release of new and updated XML feed versions. For a quick start consider consulting the DemoProject, which can be found in GitHub releases. The SDK uses the following 3rd party libraries: OpenTelemetry (1.6.0) Dawn.Guard (1.12.0) Humanizer (2.14.1) Microsoft.Extensions.Logging (7.0.0) Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory (7.0.0) Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration (7.0.0) Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks (7.0.11) Microsoft.Extensions.Http (7.0.0) RabbitMQ.Client (6.5.0)"
