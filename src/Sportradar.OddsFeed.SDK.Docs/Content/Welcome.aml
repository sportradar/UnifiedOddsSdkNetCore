		UnifiedFeed SDK is a client library that enables easier integration with the Betradar XML feeds. SDK exposes XML feed service interface in a more user-friendly way and isolates the client from having to do XML feed parsing, proper connection handling, error recovery, event queuing, data caching and dispatching. It also makes a client solution more stable and robust when it comes to feed handling, especially with the release of new and updated XML feed versions.

			  The SDK is provided as a code library (Sportradar.OddsFeed.SDK.dll), which is available on the SDK
			  site and via the NuGet package manager. The usage of NuGet package manager is
			  recommended, since it supports update notifications and makes it easier to obtain new
			  releases of the SDK.
